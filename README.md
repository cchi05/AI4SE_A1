For this program, both training and testing data should be tokenized in a CSV file (spreadsheet), as described here:
https://docs.cortext.net/data-formats/#:~:text=by%20CorText%20Manager.-,Csv,December%2023rd%202001%20for%20instance)
Name the file containing your training data train.csv. The file containing your test data can be named whatever you like. We recommend test.csv.

To run the program, open a terminal of your choice and navigate to the directory containing all of the files. Then run the command:

python ngram.py test.csv

Where test.csv is replaced with the name of your test data file, including the file extension.
